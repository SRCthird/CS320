## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure functionality and security by implementing strong 
testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), conducting code 
reviews, and using static and dynamic analysis tools to 
catch vulnerabilities early. Regular dependency updates 
and secure coding practices, such as input validation, 
further enhance security.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I gather and analyze user requirements through interviews or 
feedback, then prioritize these needs into actionable items 
like user stories, ensuring each feature aligns with user 
goals. Continuously refine the program based on ongoing 
feedback to meet evolving needs.

## How do I approach designing software?
I design software with a clear architecture, like monolithic 
or microservice, and modular components for maintainability. 
Use design patterns and prototypes to ensure scalability and 
usability, and document the process to support development 
and future updates.
